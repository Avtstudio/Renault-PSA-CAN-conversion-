# Renault-PSA-CAN-conversion-
Target to connect a PSA Multi Media System (RD45) into a Renault MEG II CC with CAN controlled display
Renault is using in their models CAN bus for engine data, the radio works with traditional power connection via con 15 and con 30, the PSA Radios already use the CAn signals to switch on and off. Also the steering wheel remote and the display functions should be converted from Renault to the PSA Radio unit. If this is at all possible I do not know so that is the first idea to see if and then how to archive this target. 

Anyone having already similar concepts are happily welcome to help an absolute newby in this field ;-)
